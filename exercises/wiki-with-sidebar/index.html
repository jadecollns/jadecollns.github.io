                    Instagram[a] is a photo and video sharing 
                    social networking service owned by Meta 
                    Platforms. It allows users to upload media 
                    that can be edited with filters, be organized 
                    by hashtags, and be associated with a location 
                    via geographical tagging. Posts can be shared 
                    publicly or with preapproved followers. Users 
                    can browse other users' content by tags and 
                    locations, view trending content, like photos, 
                    and follow other users to add their content to 
                    a personal feed.[8] A Meta-operated image-centric 
                    social media platform, it is available on iOS, 
                    Android, Windows 10, and the web. Users can take 
                    photos and edit them using built-in filters and 
                    other tools, then share them on other social media 
                    platforms like Facebook. It supports 32 languages 
                    including English, Spanish, French, Korean, and 
                    Japanese.[9]

                    Instagram began development in San Francisco as 
                    Burbn, a mobile check-in app created by Kevin 
                    Systrom and Mike Krieger. On March 5, 2010, Systrom 
                    closed a $500,000 (equivalent to $682,200 in 2023) 
                    seed funding round with Baseline Ventures and 
                    Andreessen Horowitz while working on Burbn.[10][11] 
                    Realizing that it was too similar to Foursquare, 
                    they refocused their app on photo-sharing, which 
                    had become a popular feature among its users.[12][13] 
                    They renamed it Instagram, a portmanteau of instant 
                    camera and telegram.[14]

                    Josh Riedel joined the company in October as 
                    Community Manager,[15] Shayne Sweeney joined 
                    in November as an engineer,[15] and Jessica 
                    Zollman joined as a Community Evangelist in 
                    August 2011.[15][16]

                    The first Instagram post was a photo of South 
                    Beach Harbor at Pier 38, posted by Mike Krieger 
                    at 5:26 p.m. on July 16, 2010.[17][13] 
                    On October 6, 2010, the Instagram iOS app was 
                    officially released through the App Store. 
                    In February 2011, it was reported that Instagram 
                    had raised $7 million (equivalent to $9,357,057 
                    in 2023) in Series A funding from a variety of 
                    investors, including Benchmark Capital, Jack Dorsey, 
                    Chris Sacca (through Capital fund), and Adam D'Angelo.
                    [18] The deal valued Instagram at around 
                    $20 million. In April 2012, Instagram raised 
                    $50 million (equivalent to $65,610,000 in 2023) 
                    from venture capitalists with a valuation of $500
                    million (equivalent to $656,100,000 in 2023).[19] 
                    Joshua Kushner was the second largest investor in 
                    Instagram's Series B fundraising round, leading his 
                    investment firm, Thrive Capital, to double its money 
                    after the sale to Facebook.[20]

                <p>
                    On April 3, 2012, Instagram released a version 
                    of its app for Android phones,[21][22] 
                    and it was downloaded more than one million times 
                    in less than one day.[23] The Android app 
                    has since received two significant updates: 
                    first, in March 2014, which cut the file size of 
                    the app by half and added performance 
                    improvements;[24][25] then in April 2017, 
                    to add an offline mode that allows users to view 
                    and interact with content without an Internet 
                    onnection. At the time of the announcement, it was 
                    reported that 80% of Instagram's 600 million users 
                    were located outside the U.S., and while the 
                    aforementioned functionality was live at its 
                    announcement, Instagram also announced its intention 
                    to make more features available offline, and that they 
                    were "exploring an iOS version". On April 9, 2012, 
                    Facebook, Inc. (now Meta Platforms) bought Instagram 
                    for $1 billion (equivalent to $1,312,000,000 in 2023) 
                    in cash and stock,[26][27][28] with a 
                    plan to keep the company independently 
                    managed.[29][30][31] Britain's Office of
                    Fair Trading approved the deal on August 14, 
                    2012,[32] and on August 22, 2012, the Federal 
                    Trade Commission in the U.S. closed its investigation, 
                    allowing the deal to proceed.[33] On September
                    6, 2012, the deal between Instagram and Facebook 
                    officially closed with a purchase price of $300 
                    million in cash and 23 million shares of stock.[34]

                    In January 2011, Instagram introduced hashtags 
                    to help users discover both photos and each other.
                    [149][150] Instagram encourages users to make 
                    tags both specific and relevant, rather than tagging 
                    generic words like "photo", to make photographs stand 
                    out and to attract like-minded Instagram users.[151]

                <p>
                    In June 2012, Instagram introduced "Explore", 
                    a tab inside the app that displays popular photos, 
                    photos taken at nearby locations, and search.[158] 
                    The tab was updated in June 2015 to feature trending 
                    tags and places, curated content, and the ability to 
                    search for locations.[159] In April 2016, Instagram 
                    added a "Videos You Might Like" channel to the 
                    tab,[160][161] followed by an "Events" channel 
                    in August, featuring videos from concerts, sports 
                    games, and other live events,[162][163] followed 
                    by the addition of Instagram Stories in October.
                    [164][165] The tab was later expanded again in 
                    November 2016 after Instagram Live launched to display 
                    an algorithmically curated page of the "best" Instagram 
                    Live videos currently airing.[166] In May 2017, 
                    Instagram once again updated the Explore tab to 
                    promote public Stories content from nearby 
                    places.[167]
