        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <p>MAKE THE CHEESE FILLING</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                To a mixing bowl, add the cream cheese,
                granulated white sugar, sweetened condensed
                milk, and a pinch of salt.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Use a stand mixer or hand mixer and whisk 
                until smooth. Set aside. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>ASSEMBLE AND BAKE</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350°F.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Make 6 cuts across each bagel but do not make
                the cuts going all the way down. Cut a small 
                section out of each cut to make room for the 
                cream cheese filling. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Using a piping bag or ziploc bag with the tip 
                cut off, fill the bagel with the cream cheese 
                filling in each of the cuts.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once all the bagels are filled, dunk each of 
                them in the garlic butter. Fully submerge it, 
                then let any excess drip off, and place it on 
                a baking tray lined with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Bake in the oven for 11 to 13 minutes or 
                until golden brown all around.  
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Once out of the oven, garnish with more chopped
                parsley and grated parmesan. Allow to cool down 
                and then enjoy!
